Let's explore the key areas you must cover to ensure you hire a developer who can build for today's needs and architect for tomorrow's challenges.

## 1. Describe Your Experience with Cloud Platforms and DevOps

One of the most crucial questions to ask a web developer today goes beyond their coding ability and into their operational expertise. Asking a candidate to detail their experience with cloud platforms and DevOps practices directly assesses their ability to build, deploy, and maintain modern, scalable applications. This isn't just about knowing cloud service names; it's about understanding how to leverage the cloud to create efficient, automated, and resilient systems.

![Cloud-based CI/CD pipeline deploying applications to servers, illustrating automated software delivery.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpratt9/john-pratt.com/master/src/frontend/content/posts/questions-to-ask-web-developer/questions-to-ask-web-developer-ci-cd-pipeline.jpg)

In an era where infrastructure is code, a developer's value multiplies when they can manage the entire application lifecycle. This question helps you evaluate their hands-on skills in areas critical to business success, such as cost optimization, security, and rapid feature deployment.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer proficient in cloud and DevOps is more than a programmer; they are a problem-solver who understands the bigger picture of software delivery. Their skills directly impact your ability to scale services, reduce manual deployment errors, and secure your infrastructure. For companies like Pratt Solutions that specialize in automation and cloud engineering, this expertise is non-negotiable.

### What to Listen For

A strong answer will move beyond buzzwords and provide concrete examples. Look for specific projects where the candidate made a tangible impact.

* **Good Answer Example:** "On my last project, I used **Terraform to provision our entire AWS infrastructure**, including VPCs, EC2 instances, and RDS databases. This allowed us to spin up identical staging and production environments in minutes. I also configured a **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions** that automated testing and deployed our containerized application to an Amazon EKS cluster, which cut our deployment time by 80%."

* **Red Flag:** "I've read a lot about AWS and know it's important. I have some experience with EC2." This vague response suggests a lack of practical, hands-on experience and an inability to contribute to a modern deployment workflow.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "Can you walk me through a deployment pipeline you built or significantly improved?"
* "How have you approached cost optimization and monitoring for cloud resources?"
* "Describe a time you had to troubleshoot a failed deployment in a cloud environment."
* "What are your thoughts on serverless architecture versus container orchestration like Kubernetes?"

## 2. What is Your Experience with Modern Frontend Frameworks?

This question probes a developer's ability to create the dynamic, interactive user interfaces that modern web applications demand. Proficiency in frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular is fundamental for building responsive, performant, and maintainable frontends. It's about more than just knowing syntax; it's about understanding component-based architecture, state management, and the ecosystem of tools that support these powerful technologies.

![Illustration of responsive web design across desktop and mobile with a page speed gauge.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpratt9/john-pratt.com/master/src/frontend/content/posts/questions-to-ask-web-developer/questions-to-ask-web-developer-page-speed.jpg)

In a world where user experience is a key differentiator, a developer's frontend skills directly influence engagement, conversion, and customer satisfaction. This question helps you gauge their capacity to translate complex requirements into elegant, functional user interfaces that perform well across all devices.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer skilled in modern frontend frameworks can build sophisticated single-page applications (SPAs) that feel fast and seamless. Their expertise is crucial for creating reusable component libraries that enforce design consistency and accelerate development. For Pratt Solutions, where delivering high-quality web applications is paramount, a candidate's depth with React, including its state management and performance optimization techniques, is a critical indicator of their value.

### What to Listen For

A strong candidate will provide specific examples of applications they've built and the technical decisions they made along the way. They should be able to articulate the 'why' behind their choices.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I primarily work with **React and TypeScript**. In my recent role, I led the development of a dashboard that handled real-time data updates using **React Query for server state management**. I also built a reusable component library with Storybook to ensure UI consistency and implemented server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js to improve initial page load times and SEO."

* **Red Flag:** "I've used a bit of React and I know how to make components." This type of answer lacks depth and fails to demonstrate an understanding of the broader frontend ecosystem, including state management, testing, and performance.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "How do you handle state management in a large-scale React application?"
* "Can you describe your approach to testing frontend components?"
* "How do you ensure your web applications are accessible (WCAG compliant)?"
* "What build tools, like Vite or Webpack, have you used and why would you choose one over the other?"

## 3. How Do You Approach Database Design and SQL Optimization?

A web application is only as good as the data layer that supports it. This question digs into a developer's understanding of how to structure, manage, and query data efficiently. It evaluates their grasp of foundational concepts like database normalization, indexing, and performance tuning, which are critical for building applications that are both scalable and maintainable.

![A diagram illustrating database components like Oerm, Query Dress, Dtease, Schema, and SQL, with a magnifying glass focused on an index, suggesting optimization.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpratt9/john-pratt.com/master/src/frontend/content/posts/questions-to-ask-web-developer/questions-to-ask-web-developer-database-indexing.jpg)

The ability to design a logical schema and write optimized queries prevents future bottlenecks, ensures data integrity, and directly impacts application speed. It's the difference between an application that performs smoothly under load and one that grinds to a halt as user numbers grow.

### Why This Question Matters

For a company like Pratt Solutions, with deep expertise in data engineering across platforms like PostgreSQL, OracleDB, and Snowflake, this is a cornerstone skill. A developer who can architect a robust database schema and fine-tune queries is an invaluable asset. They can reduce infrastructure costs, improve user experience, and ensure the reliability of critical business data.

### What to Listen For

A strong answer will demonstrate a clear thought process and cite specific, real-world examples. To truly assess a candidate's practical skills in this area, you might also want to explore some [advanced SQL interview questions](https://www.remotely.works/blog/top-advanced-sql-interview-questions-and-answers).

* **Good Answer Example:** "In a recent project, our application's dashboard was loading slowly. I used **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL** to identify a full table scan on a large transactions table. By adding a composite index on the `user_id` and `transaction_date` columns, I **reduced the query time from 5 seconds to under 50 milliseconds**. I also prioritize a normalized schema design to ensure data integrity, typically aiming for Third Normal Form (3NF)."

* **Red Flag:** "I just let the ORM handle it. I don't really write raw SQL." This indicates a heavy reliance on abstractions without understanding the underlying performance implications, a major risk for scalable applications.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "When would you choose to de-normalize a database schema, and what are the trade-offs?"
* "Describe your experience with different types of database indexes (e.g., B-tree, Hash, GIN)."
* "How do you approach designing a schema for a system that requires both transactional processing (OLTP) and analytics (OLAP)?"
* "Walk me through how you would ensure data integrity and handle transactions."

## 4. Tell Us About Your Experience with API Development and Integration

Modern web applications rarely exist in a vacuum; they communicate with other services, databases, and third-party platforms. Asking a potential hire about their experience with API development and integration is one of the most revealing questions to ask a web developer. It directly probes their ability to build the connective tissue that makes sophisticated, feature-rich applications possible. This question assesses their skills in designing, securing, and scaling the data pipelines between systems.

From mobile apps fetching user data to e-commerce platforms processing payments, APIs are the engine of modern digital ecosystems. A developer who can't confidently build or consume an API is limited to creating isolated, monolithic applications. This question helps you find candidates who can build interconnected, scalable, and powerful software solutions.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer skilled in API design understands how to create clean, logical, and secure endpoints that other systems can reliably use. Their expertise is crucial for building microservices architectures, integrating with third-party services like payment gateways, and enabling your application to communicate with other parts of your business. For a company like Pratt Solutions, where custom cloud solutions often require integrating diverse systems, this skill is fundamental.

### What to Listen For

A strong answer will go beyond simply stating they've "worked with APIs." It should demonstrate a deep understanding of design principles, security protocols, and real-world application.

* **Good Answer Example:** "In a recent project, I designed and built a **REST API using Node.js and Express** to serve data to our mobile app. I implemented **OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication** and used Swagger/OpenAPI for comprehensive documentation. I also handled API versioning through the URL path to ensure backward compatibility and integrated a third-party payment gateway, which involved handling webhooks for real-time transaction updates."

* **Red Flag:** "I've used APIs before to get data for a project." This response is too generic and lacks any detail about their role, the technologies used, or the challenges they overcame. It suggests their experience is limited to basic consumption rather than design and implementation.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "How do you approach API security? What measures would you take to prevent common vulnerabilities?"
* "Can you explain the difference between REST and GraphQL and when you might choose one over the other?"
* "Describe your process for documenting an API to make it easy for other developers to use."
* "Walk me through a complex integration you've completed with a third-party service. What were the main challenges?"

## 5. Describe Your Experience with Automation and Infrastructure-as-Code

Another of the most critical questions to ask a web developer focuses on their ability to automate infrastructure management. Asking a candidate to detail their experience with Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform assesses their capability to eliminate manual processes, reduce human error, and create consistent, repeatable environments. This practice treats infrastructure configuration as software, managed through code and version control.

This question moves beyond simple server setup and into strategic, scalable infrastructure deployment. A developer skilled in IaC can define and provision an entire multi-cloud environment by running a script, ensuring that development, staging, and production are identical. This is a foundational skill for any modern, agile team.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer proficient in IaC directly contributes to operational excellence and speed. They can codify complex infrastructure, place it under version control, and automate its deployment, which significantly accelerates development cycles and improves reliability. For companies like Pratt Solutions that prioritize automation, this expertise is essential for building resilient and efficient systems.

### What to Listen For

A strong answer will demonstrate practical application and a deep understanding of IaC principles, not just tool names. The candidate should be able to articulate how their automation work solved specific business problems.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I led a project to migrate our manual AWS setup to an **Infrastructure-as-Code model using Terraform**. I wrote modules to define our VPC, subnets, security groups, and EKS cluster configuration. We used **Terraform Cloud for collaborative state management** and integrated it into a GitOps workflow with GitHub Actions. This reduced our new environment provisioning time from days to under 30 minutes and eliminated configuration drift."

* **Red Flag:** "I've heard of Terraform and think it's cool. I've used the AWS console to set up servers before." This response indicates a theoretical-only understanding and a lack of the hands-on experience needed for modern infrastructure management.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "How do you manage state and handle secrets within your Terraform configurations?"
* "Can you describe a strategy you've used for testing your infrastructure code before applying it?"
* "Explain a time you had to refactor a large, monolithic IaC configuration into reusable modules."
* "What are the main benefits of using an IaC tool over manual configuration or custom scripts?"

For a deeper dive into IaC, our [Terraform tutorial for beginners](https://www.john-pratt.com/terraform-tutorial-for-beginners/) provides an excellent starting point.

## 6. What Programming Languages Are You Proficient In, and How Do You Choose?

This is one of the most fundamental questions to ask a web developer, yet its value lies in the second half of the question: "How do you choose?" While knowing a developer's technical skills is essential, understanding their strategic thinking behind technology selection is what separates a good coder from a great architect. It reveals their ability to align technical decisions with business goals, performance requirements, and long-term project maintainability.

This question probes beyond a simple list of languages on a resume. It assesses their practical wisdom, adaptability, and understanding that the "best" language is always context-dependent. It shows whether they follow trends blindly or make informed decisions based on the unique challenges of a project.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer's choice of programming language directly impacts everything from application performance and scalability to the speed of development and the ease of finding future talent to maintain the code. For a company like Pratt Solutions, which leverages specific languages like Python for data engineering, GoLang for high-concurrency systems, and Node.js for scalable microservices, a candidate's ability to justify their choices is paramount. It demonstrates their technical maturity and alignment with a pragmatic, results-oriented engineering culture.

### What to Listen For

A strong candidate will articulate a clear, reasoned process for language selection, often citing specific trade-offs. They will connect the language's strengths to the project's requirements.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I'm most proficient in **Python and GoLang**. For a recent data processing pipeline that required heavy integration with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, I chose **Python** for its mature ecosystem and ease of use. However, for a high-throughput API gateway that needed to handle thousands of concurrent requests with low latency, I opted for **GoLang** due to its lightweight goroutines and excellent performance in concurrent environments. The choice always depends on the specific problem; for instance, I'd lean toward **Node.js** for a real-time chat application due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model."

* **Red Flag:** "I only use JavaScript because it's what I know best and it can do everything." This answer shows a lack of flexibility, an unwillingness to learn new tools, and a failure to appreciate that different problems require different solutions.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new programming language for a project. What was your process?"
* "When would you choose a statically-typed language like Java or Go over a dynamically-typed one like Python or JavaScript, and vice-versa?"
* "How does the ecosystem (libraries, community, tooling) of a language influence your decision?"
* "Can you describe a project where the initial language choice turned out to be a mistake? What did you learn from that?"

## 7. How Do You Approach Testing and Quality Assurance?

A critical question to ask a web developer is how they ensure their code works reliably under all conditions. Discussing their approach to testing and quality assurance (QA) reveals their commitment to quality, discipline, and building robust, maintainable software. This moves beyond just writing code that functions; it probes their process for preventing bugs, ensuring stability, and validating that the application meets requirements.

In today's complex software ecosystems, a "it works on my machine" attitude is unacceptable. A developer who integrates testing into their workflow from the beginning produces higher-quality code, reduces long-term maintenance costs, and enables faster, more confident deployments.

### Why This Question Matters

For companies like Pratt Solutions, which deliver mission-critical systems for aerospace, finance, and energy sectors, software failure is not an option. A developer's approach to QA is a direct indicator of their professionalism and their ability to build trustworthy solutions. It demonstrates an understanding that preventing defects is far more efficient and cost-effective than fixing them after they have reached production.

### What to Listen For

A strong candidate will describe a multi-layered testing strategy, not just a single technique. They should articulate the purpose of different testing types and provide specific examples of tools and frameworks they have used.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I follow a comprehensive testing pyramid strategy. I write **unit tests using Jest** for individual functions to achieve over 80% code coverage on critical business logic. For component interactions, I use **React Testing Library**. Then, I create **integration tests** to verify that our service correctly communicates with third-party APIs and our database. Finally, we have an **end-to-end test suite using Cypress** that simulates user journeys, which is automated in our CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before deployment."

* **Red Flag:** "I test my code manually by clicking around to make sure it works before I push it. We can add automated tests later if we have time." This response indicates a lack of discipline and a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to quality.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "Can you describe your experience with Test-Driven Development (TDD)?"
* "How do you decide what to test and determine adequate test coverage?"
* "Walk me through how you would approach adding tests to a legacy application with no existing test suite."
* "What are your thoughts on balancing testing thoroughness with development speed?"

## 8. Describe Your Experience with Containerization and Kubernetes

This question digs into a developer's modern application packaging and deployment skills. Asking about their experience with containerization (like Docker) and orchestration (like Kubernetes) is a direct way to gauge their ability to build portable, scalable, and resilient microservices architectures. It moves beyond traditional server management to a more dynamic, automated, and cloud-native approach.

![Illustration of shipping containers, a clock, and network nodes, depicting logistics and data management.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpratt9/john-pratt.com/master/src/frontend/content/posts/questions-to-ask-web-developer/questions-to-ask-web-developer-logistics.jpg)

Containerization ensures that an application works uniformly across different environments, from a developer's laptop to a production cloud server. Kubernetes takes this a step further by automating the deployment, scaling, and management of these containerized applications. This skill set is fundamental for companies that rely on microservices and cloud infrastructure.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer who understands containerization is crucial for maintaining development-production parity, which significantly reduces deployment-day surprises. Expertise in Kubernetes is a force multiplier, enabling your team to manage complex applications with high availability and automated scaling. For firms like Pratt Solutions, which engineer robust cloud solutions, this knowledge is essential for delivering modern, efficient systems.

### What to Listen For

A compelling answer will demonstrate hands-on experience with both creating container images and managing them in a production-like environment. The candidate should be able to articulate the "why" behind their technical choices.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I containerized a legacy monolith using a multi-stage **Docker build** to create a lightweight image. We then deployed it to a **Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS**. I wrote Helm charts to manage the deployments and configured a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to handle traffic spikes, which improved our application's availability by 99.9% and simplified our release process."

* **Red Flag:** "I've run a few Docker containers on my machine for some tutorials. I know Kubernetes is for running them." This answer shows only surface-level familiarity and lacks the practical depth needed to manage real-world systems.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "How do you ensure your Docker images are secure and optimized for size?"
* "Can you explain the difference between a Deployment, a StatefulSet, and a DaemonSet in Kubernetes?"
* "Describe a time you had to debug a failing pod in a Kubernetes cluster."
* "What strategies have you used for managing configuration and secrets in Kubernetes?"

## 9. How Do You Stay Current with Technology Trends and Continuously Learn?

The technology landscape evolves at an astonishing pace, and a developer's skills can quickly become outdated. This essential question to ask a web developer probes their commitment to continuous learning and professional growth. It reveals whether they are a passive coder or a proactive technologist who actively seeks out new knowledge to stay relevant and effective.

A candidate's learning habits are a direct indicator of their future value. In an industry where new frameworks, cloud services, and security threats emerge daily, a developer who isn't learning is falling behind. This question helps you gauge their passion for the craft and their ability to bring modern, efficient solutions to your projects.

### Why This Question Matters

A developer with a strong continuous learning mindset is an invaluable asset. They are more likely to introduce innovative solutions, adopt best practices, and anticipate technological shifts. For a company like Pratt Solutions, which operates at the forefront of cloud engineering and data solutions, hiring developers who are perpetually curious and self-motivated is fundamental to maintaining a competitive edge and delivering cutting-edge results.

### What to Listen For

A strong candidate will provide specific, actionable examples of their learning activities. They will demonstrate a structured and intentional approach to professional development rather than a passive one.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I dedicate a few hours each week to professional development. Recently, I've been focused on AI integrations, so I completed a course on using the OpenAI API and built a side project that leverages large language models for data analysis. I also stay current by contributing to a **Terraform open-source module**, following industry blogs like The New Stack, and I'm currently studying for my **AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification** to deepen my cloud expertise."

* **Red Flag:** "I read articles when I have time." This answer is vague and shows a lack of a deliberate strategy for staying current. It suggests the candidate may rely on outdated practices and struggle to adapt to new project requirements.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "Tell me about a new technology you've learned in the last six months. What prompted you to learn it, and how did you apply it?"
* "What blogs, podcasts, or newsletters do you follow to stay informed about the industry?"
* "How do you evaluate whether a new tool or framework is worth adopting for a project?"
* "Can you describe a time you mentored a junior developer or shared knowledge with your team?"

## 10. Tell Us About a Complex Project You've Completed and the Challenges You Overcame

This open-ended, behavioral question is one of the most revealing questions to ask a web developer. It moves beyond theoretical knowledge and into the practical realities of project execution, forcing candidates to articulate their problem-solving process, resilience, and technical depth. You aren't just asking about code; you're asking about their ability to navigate ambiguity, collaborate under pressure, and deliver tangible results.

This question provides a window into how a developer thinks and operates. It reveals their definition of "complex," the scale of projects they are comfortable with, and their ability to take ownership of challenges. For a firm like Pratt Solutions, which handles mission-critical projects for enterprise clients, understanding a candidate's experience with genuine complexity is essential.

### Why This Question Matters

Technical skills are only one part of the equation. A developer's ability to analyze a difficult problem, architect a solution, and communicate the process to stakeholders is what separates a good developer from a great one. This question helps you gauge their technical decision-making, their approach to unforeseen obstacles, and whether they learn from their experiences. It uncovers their capacity for leadership and accountability.

### What to Listen For

A strong answer provides a clear narrative with a defined problem, a detailed solution, and a measurable outcome. The candidate should be able to articulate the "why" behind their technical choices.

* **Good Answer Example:** "I led the refactoring of a monolithic legacy application into a microservices architecture for a financial services client. The biggest challenge was ensuring zero downtime for a system processing thousands of transactions per minute. We used a **strangler fig pattern**, incrementally migrating services to a **Kubernetes cluster on AWS**. I designed the new event-driven architecture using **Kafka** to decouple services. The result was a 90% reduction in deployment failures and a 75% improvement in feature development speed."

* **Red Flag:** "We had a tough project with a tight deadline. I had to work a lot of overtime to get the code done, but we eventually launched it." This answer lacks technical detail, avoids discussing specific challenges, and fails to demonstrate ownership or a structured problem-solving approach.

### Suggested Follow-Up Questions

* "What technical trade-offs did you have to make and why?"
* "How did you communicate progress and roadblocks to non-technical stakeholders?"
* "What was the most significant mistake made during the project, and what did you learn from it?"
* "If you could start that project over, what would you do differently from a technical or architectural standpoint?"
